A OS X APP Without XCode
========================
This create by editor(Emacs), use .h, .m, Info.plist and Makefile.

It show a sample app without any window but a main menu.

The first menu while become app menu, so the app name will override
menu title.

I make it support arc.

With Info.plist, you can ignore [NSApp run] in main function.
